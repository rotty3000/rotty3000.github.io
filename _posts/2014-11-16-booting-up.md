I've been wanting to setup a personal blog for a while. It'll probably be of little use to most people but I'm in need of a place to do brain dumps mostly for the purpose of ranting and otherwise working through thoughts which plague me.

I might jump from software engineering to science, neither of which I know much about, though both intrigue and interest me greatly.

Anyhow, That's all for now.

Bye!

## Sample Heading

### Sample Heading 2

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
