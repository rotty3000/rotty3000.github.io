excerpt: "I'm a software engineer, primarily working with Java."

I live in Canada and am a proud husband and father of 2 children.

I work as a software engineer for [Liferay, Inc.](http://liferay.com). I'm also working with the [OSGi Alliance](http://osgi.org) as part of the Core and Enterprise expert groups and currently am co-chair of the Enterprise expert group. I'm also a committer on the [Eclipse Equinox](https://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) project.

I absolutely love open source and am honored to work everyday with it.

I enjoy reading books and watching movies of fantasy, sci-fi, action/adventure genres or any combination thereof.
